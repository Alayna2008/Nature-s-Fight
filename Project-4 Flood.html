           <h2> What is Flood</h2>
           <p>A flood is a rise of water with no place to go. Floods come in all depths, from just a couple inches to many feet. The power of floodwater is extraordinary and lethal. In less than an hour, strong rain can turn an ankle deep creek into an unstoppable 30-foot-high swell that overpowers everything in its path.Damaging flooding may happen with only a few inches of water, or it may cover a house to the rooftop. Floods can occur within minutes or over a long period, and may last days, weeks, or longer. Floods are the most common and widespread of all weather-related natural disasters.</p>
              <p>Flash floods are the most dangerous kind of floods, because they combine the destructive power of a flood with incredible speed. Flash floods occur when heavy rainfall exceeds the ability of the ground to absorb it. They also occur when water fills normally dry creeks or streams or enough water accumulates for streams to overtop their banks, causing rapid rises of water in a short amount of time. They can happen within minutes of the causative rainfall, limiting the time available to warn and protect the public.</p>
            
              <h2>Causes Of Flood</h2>
         <p class="content"> 1.Heavy rainfall </p>
         </p>  
         <p class="content"> 2.Ocean waves coming on shore, such as a storm surge
         </p>
         <p class="content"> 3.Melting of snow and ice, as well as ice jams
         </p> 
         <p class="content"> 4.Dams or levees breaking
        </p>
        <h2>Effects Of Flood</h2>
         <p class="content"> 1.Loss of lives and property </p>
         </p>  
         <p class="content"> 2.Loss of livelihoods:
         </p>
         <p class="content"> 3.Decreased purchasing and production power
         </p> 
         <p class="content"> 4.Decrease in economic growth and development
        </p>
        <p>No matter how quickly it happens or the cause, flooding is deadly. Floods kill more people and causes more damage than other severe weather related events. Many die trying to drive or walk through a flooded area. Just six inches of water can knock a person off their feet. Just two feet of water can carry a car away.

        <h2>Measures to be taken during flood</h2>
         <p class="content"> 1.Seek higher ground. </p>
         </p>  
         <p class="content"> 2.Be aware of flash flood areas such as canals, streams, drainage channels.
         </p>
         <p class="content"> 3.Be ready to evacuate.
         </p> 
         <p class="content"> 4.Turn off utilities at main switches and unplug appliances - do not touch electrical equipment if wet.
